        <h3><strong>hello all</strong></h3>
        <p>gravo is a 26 year old man that was born in the capitol of iceland, reykjavík.
        <br>he was forced to be relocated to the far east of iceland to a small town called 
        <br>seyðisfjörður at the age of only 9 months old.
        <br>
        <br>gravo was raised by his grandparents who a few months later in the year after, 
        <br>had their own son - his father's half brother. despite that they were practically
        <br>raised as twins for the first years of their lives.
        <br>
        <br>gravo had a normal childhood for the most part, except for the whole relocation part.
        <br>gravo was lucky, in that he was allowed to have a relationship with his parents.
        <br>gravo often took a planeride over to the capitol to meet and spend time with them.
        <br>his parents also frequently visited him in seyðisfjörður.
        <br>
        <br>gravo has a few diagnoses, adhd, tourettes and anxiety.
        <br>today, gravo is happy, in love and thrives not inspite of his conditions, but because of them.
